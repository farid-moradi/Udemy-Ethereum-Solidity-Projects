# Ethereum and Solidity Projects

This repository contains projects introduced in [Ethereum and Solidity: The Complete Developer's Guide](https://github.com/StephenGrider/EthereumCasts) by Stephen Grider.

## Introduction

The Ethereum development world has seen many changes since the creation and update of the course. While the course provides a solid foundation in explaining concepts, it's essential to adapt to the technology changes. This repository serves as a companion to the course, allowing developers to leverage the concepts taught while staying updated with the latest practices in Ethereum development.

## Course Content

The course is divided into four main sections:

1. **Basics and Simple Smart Contracts (Inbox):** Introduction to Ethereum basics and development of scripts to compile and deploy a simple smart contract named Inbox.

2. **Intermediate Smart Contracts (Lottery):** Development of a slightly more complex smart contract named Lottery, allowing users to participate in a lottery with winners chosen randomly.

3. **Frontend Development with React:** Understanding the importance of frontend components in decentralized systems and developing a frontend application for the lottery program using React. While the course uses class components, this repository utilizes functional components.

4. **Advanced Multipage Application with Next.js:** Development of an advanced multipage application using Next.js. Stephen explains the rationale behind choosing Next.js in detail. The project aims to create a decentralized version of [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/).
